# Elasticity of electricity demand
[Cathrine Falbe Pedersen](https://github.com/CathrinePedersen) and I estimate the price elasticity of electricity demand with respect to the hourly spot price, using Danish data from [Energinet](https://www.energidataservice.dk/en/dataset/consumptionpergridarea) on 48 grid companies for each hour of the years 2016-2018 split into wholesale and retail electricity consumption.

The project is a part of the 2019 seminar course in [Energy Economics](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kk08318u/2018-2019) held by Frederik Roose Øvlisen at University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics.
