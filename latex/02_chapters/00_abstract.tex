We estimate the hour-by-hour price elasticity of electricity consumption for wholesale and retail consumers in Denmark using hourly consumption data for 48 grid areas from January 2016 to December 2018. We use the Random Effects Instrument Variable (REIV) estimator where electricity spot prices are instrumented using the prognosis for wind-power production to overcome concerns of endogeneity.\footnote{On Github we provide a well-structured overview of Python and Stata code as well as all estimation tables with the complete set of time controls: \href{https://github.com/thornoe/energy}{github.com/thornoe/energy}}
\par
For peak-hours our estimated price elasticities of -0.048 for wholesale consumption and -0.027 for retail consumption are modest in size. Similarly we find a relatively small effect from the introduction of a time-of-use tariff in the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area. Overall, our results suggest that decentralized, price-based tools to alter electricity demand should not stand alone. However, our results are not definitive and further research should be devoted to this topic.
